        About Mineshafter Squared
    </h1>
    <div class="info_track">
        <p>
            Mineshafter Squared is an authentication and texture proxy for the
            popular game <a href-"http://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>
            created by <a href="http://notch.tumblr.com/">Notch</a> of
            <a href="http://mojang.com/">Mojang</a>. It gets in the
            middle of the game clients and its outbound calls to the minecraft
            servers. This allows my service to provide its own login system for
            the game which enables players to try out the game before buying. My
            authentication service is also online whenever the official
            Minecraft server's go down. That is not as much a problem anymore,
            but was very useful in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
            The proxy also allows me to offer an amazing texture management
            system that far outshines the official service. Users can upload
            multiple textures to switch between, discover new textures, and
            share them with their friends and the community.

        <p>
            Mineshafter Squared is a bit of an odd name, this is because I based
            my work off of the <a href="http://mineshafter.info/">Original
            Mineshafter</a> and was trying to be clever. I built the Mineshafter
            Squared authentication server and website from the ground up myself,
            I only used the <a
            href="https://github.com/download13/Mineshafter-Proxy">Mineshafter
            proxy code</a> to help get me started. The creator of Mineshafter,
            <a href="https://github.com/download13">download13</a>, also helped
            me out along the way. I have changed much of his original code for
            my own uses, but I would not have been able to make any of this
            without that bit of help.
