Note & Concerns
===============

*   The way I currently load in the navigation (either through application or admin layouts) bothers me.  I want to eventually refactor so the menu is loaded in from a separate view.  This may make the whole "layout" idea pointless, just something to think about.  Its working now so I wont touch it, but if making this change will make other things in the future easier it may be worth thinking about.
